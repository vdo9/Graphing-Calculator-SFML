# C++ Graphing Calculator Built with SFML Multimedia Library

## Objective
As part of my final project for my advanced C++ course at Pasadena City College, I created a Graphing Calculator using SFML, a simple API for creating games and various multimedia components. In my class, as a progression towards this final project, I developed a thorough understanding of pointers, classes & objects, friend functions & overloading operators, linked lists, stacks & queues, inheritance, and polymorphism. In order to implement a graphing calculator, I learned the shunting yard and rpn algorithm used to remodel and generate solutions to an expression.
