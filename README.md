# C++ Graphing Calculator Built with SFML Multimedia Library

## Objective
As part of my final project for my advanced C++ course at Pasadena City College, I created a Graphing Calculator with an interactive interface using SFML, a simple API for creating games and various multimedia components. In my class, as a progression towards this final project, I developed a thorough understanding of pointers, classes & objects, friend functions & overloading operators, linked lists, stacks & queues, inheritance, and polymorphism. In order to implement a graphing calculator, I learned the shunting yard and rpn algorithm used to remodel and generate solutions to an expression. 

I'd like to document this project as my first official project as I've faced many challenges and learned tremendously through creating this Graphing Calculator. The greatest challenge I faced and would like to continue working on is developing a better understanding on how to organize a project. Some questions I struggled with were:

What is the best way to condense my code? <br>
Where should I write the methods? <br>
When should I create an object? <br>
Should I include this logic in this part of the code? <br>

Currently, this graphing calculator can take the following expressions:
| Type                 | Example                    | 
| -------------------- |:--------------------------:| 
| Polynomials (1 term) | X^2+3 ; X^3+1 ; 3*X^3+X^2+3| 
| Trigonometric        | sin(X) ; cos(X) ; tan(X)   |
